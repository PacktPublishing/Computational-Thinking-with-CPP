## <a name="recommended-c++-style-guides">Recommended C++ Style Guides</a>

1. [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
2. [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)

`cpplint` - static code checker for C++. `cpplint` is a command-line tool to
check C/C++ files for style issues following Google's C++ style guide.

`clang-tidy` is a clang-based C++ “linter” tool. Its purpose is to provide an
extensible framework for diagnosing and fixing typical programming errors, like
style violations, interface misuse, or bugs that can be deduced via static
analysis.

## <a name="recommended-c++-code-formatter">Recommended C++ code formatter</a>

`clang-format` is a widely-used C++ code formatter. It provides an option to
define code style options in YAML-formatted files — named `.clang-format` or
`_clang-format` — and these files often become a part of your project where you
keep all code style rules. It is highly recommended to format your changed C++
code before opening pull requests, which will save you and the reviewers' time.
